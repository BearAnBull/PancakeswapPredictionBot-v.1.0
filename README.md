Running this bot for a day had made me $55 with minimum bets. Please note I was actively monitoring the market as the bot was running.

#### 📢 Advice:
- Run the bot with your wallet at a ratio of 10x the amount you choose to bet
- Adjust the bot accordingly to bet with or against the majority.
- When the chart swings, use the "--with" strategy.
- When the chart trends sideways, use the default, against strategy. 
- Always monitor & adjust the bot accordingly but allow room for error.
- Consistent gains will be made by running smaller betting amounts over longer periods of time. 
- Always account & allow room for error. Losing 3 sucks, but stopping it only prevents it from potentially winning the next 4 & bringing you to a profit. 
- Majority of the runs with over 2k plays I have a standard 54-66% win rate depending on how well I monitor it & based on market conditions.

## 📈 Updates

[Available soon]:

## ⚠️ Beware of clones!

Beware of forks. I do not give any guarantee that the fork may turn out to be a scam. I'm coding this stuff on a pure open source. I do my best to publish constant updates and bug fixes. the bot has a very small tax in the claim function, so we both win. At the same time you support me, this project and the following projects.
